## Comparing the spread in different countries
We can compare how the corona virus has spread in different countries by matching them up with the first few confirmed deaths as a result of COVID-19.
This gives us an indication of how fast the virus spreads in various countries, while accounting for the difference in when the virus reached the different country borders.
We can see below that multiple countries are on the same trajectory as Italy and most will probably pass China in fatalities soon.  

Spain is seemingly on a steeper rise than Italy and this could potentially indicate that the situation in Spain could become worse than Italy.
This becomes even clearer when you click on the linear scale as we can now see how Spain is way above what Italy what at the same point in time.
And again, we see the severity of the situation for Italy as the death toll is increasing exponentially.
