### About
This dashboard was inspired by all the other great dashboards out there.
Hopefully this one too, provides some additional useful information for those who are trying to better understand the current situation.
If you got any comments or see that I've made a mistake, or if there are any issues with the dashboard, please let me know on [GitHub](https://github.com/holwech/coronastatus) or reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JHolwech).  

Thanks to [Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE)](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) for a great dataset covering the current COVID-19 pandemic. Without this dataset, my dashboard and many others would not exist.

If you find what I done here interesting, you might also like some my other projects which can be found on my blog [holwech.github.io](https://holwech.github.io/).
