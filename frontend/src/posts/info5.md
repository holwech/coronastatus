## The effect of a lock down
The problem with using the death count as an indicator of the future, is that there will always be a delay in what we see and what will actually happen.
While it's too early to say anything about how effective the lock down of many European countries will be, we can look at how they compare with the development in China.  

It's not that easy to define what a "lock down" is, as the degree of "locking down" varies from country to country.
I have selected a few countries that to me seemed to have a day that could classify as a "lock down".
In this graph we see that many European countries were much slower than China, in implementing stricter measure for reducing infection.
Given the delay in what we see and the reality, and based on how China's death numbers kept on rising for a long time after the lock down, it's safe to say that most of these countries will levels past what China has seen.
