### Recognizing the peak
This chart may seem somewhat chaotic, but it is actually quite useful for recognizing when a country has reached its peak in terms of fatalities.
When a country starts dropping off from the mid line, this is a sign that the peak has been reached.
For example, we see that China has fallen significantly from the center mid line and is past its peak based on the data we have available.  

This plot was inspired by this [great animated chart](https://aatishb.com/covidtrends/).
