## Most countries follow the same path
If we add all the other countries with over 5 deaths to the graph, we see that most countries are following the same path.
Some countries, namely Japan and South Korea, has managed to keep the trend flat and has only had a small and steady increase in new fatalities.
The scale here is set to be logarithmic since the exponential increase in fatalities makes it hard to compare countries in different phases when represented on a normal scale.  

The trajectory of the lines tell us a lot about how the disease is going to impact a country.
If a country has a steeper ascend on the chart compared to other countries, then that country will most likely be impacted more severely.
