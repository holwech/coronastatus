## Using death tolls as a measurement
In the current situation, confirmed cases of COVID-19 through testing is not useful for understanding the development of this pandemic.
There is a severe lack of testing supplies and capasity globally, something which has forced most countries to prioritize their testing efforts towards a select number of people.  

Enough time have elapsed for death count to be useful as a indicator of how the disease has, and probably is spreading in various countries.
We see on the graph below that the fatality rate in Italy is sky-rocketing and is reaching levels of severity that is not visible when looking at the confirmed cases.
At this point, there is no doubt that in the current situation Italy will far exceed the death tolls currently counted in China.
