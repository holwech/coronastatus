## Using death tolls as a measurement
In the current situation, looking at confirmed cases of COVID-19 through testing is not useful for understanding the development of this pandemic.
There is a severe lack of testing supplies and capacity globally, something which has forced most countries to prioritize their testing efforts towards a select number of people.  

Enough time has elapsed for the death count to be a more trustworthy indicator of how the disease has, and is spreading in various countries.
Note that the death count is a lagging indicator and the spread of the disease could be on a rise or fall, despite what the death count may show.
